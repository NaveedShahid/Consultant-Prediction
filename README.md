# Consultant Prediction
Automatic assignment of a project to a consultant based on the project description
BERT model is fine-tuned on the dataset and used to predict upto three consultants based on the project description

__Notes:__
1. Custom data is needed to make use of this approach
2. The classifier is completely dependent on the text description
3. Future improvements can be to add another consultant and fine tune the network without re-training from scratch

The model automates the task of assigning consultant to a client immedietely without the manually handling clients
